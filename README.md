# DataTrek_2022_MAchine_learning

2 hours course to understand intermediate concepts of machine learning

This course was given on februray 2022 for the dataTrek organized by the IID (Quebec) and IVADO (Montreal) institutes. 
It contains advanced concept for machine learning and may allow you to set up a complete pipeline to explore your data and make your first predictions. 
The theoritical corpus is completed by a coding session. In this session, I compare in details the different ML algorithms and the complete methodology used to perform a robust machine learning analysis to predict diabete. 

The dataset used is available in Kaggle and known as the "Pima Diabete dataset" :

 Note : Please keep in mind that the puprose of the coding session was NOT to get the ebst performamnce, but rather to make a jiurney into Machine Learning. 

A PubMed search will allow you to get some background about the story :
