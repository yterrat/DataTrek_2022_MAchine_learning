# DataTrek_2022_MAchine_learning

2 hours course to understand intermediate concepts of machine learning

This course was given on februray 2022 for the IVADO (Institut de valorisation des donn√©es) in Montreal. It contains advanced concept for machine learning.
The theoritical corpus is competed by a coding session. In this session, I compare in details the different ML algorithms and the complete methodfology used to perform a robust machine learning aanalysis to predict diabete. 

The dataset used is available in Kaggle and known as the "Pima Diabete dataset".

A PubMed search will allow you to get some background about the story :
